# Project Notebooks Overview

This project contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering various machine learning topics and practical workflows. Below is a brief outline of each notebook:

## jupyter_notebooks/

- **Cluster.ipynb**: Practical examples of clustering algorithms and unsupervised learning techniques.
- **CommonAlgorithm_Hyperparameters.ipynb**: Reference guide to the most common hyperparameters for popular machine learning algorithms.
- **Functions.ipynb**: Collection of reusable machine learning functions for data processing and modeling.
- **GridSearchCV_BinaryClassifier.ipynb**: Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV for binary classification tasks.
- **GridSearchCV_MultiAlgorithm.ipynb**: Demonstrates GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning across multiple algorithms.
- **GridSearchCV_MultiClassifier.ipynb**: GridSearchCV for multiclass classification, including custom scoring and evaluation.
- **GridSearchCV_Regression.ipynb**: Hyperparameter optimization for regression models using GridSearchCV.
- **NLP.ipynb**: Natural Language Processing pipeline, including text cleaning, feature extraction, and model selection for text classification.
- **PCA.ipynb**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- **Pipeline_ML_tasks.ipynb**: Building and evaluating end-to-end machine learning pipelines for various tasks.
- **Split_Fit_Predict.ipynb**: Basic workflow for splitting data, fitting models, making predictions, and saving models.
- **TreeBased_models.ipynb**: Implementation and evaluation of tree-based models for regression and classification.


These were largely taken from examples in the CodeInstitute LMS, with some adjustments and additions by myself as a practical refernce guide for basic ML projects.
